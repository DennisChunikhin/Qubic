# Qubic
A static website that allows you to play Qubic (3 Dimensional Tic Tac Toe) on an interactive 3D board.
I made this website as a project for the Snakes and Hackers Hackathon. [View this project on Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/qubic-uo8kcg) for a more detailed description.

## Controls
Hold left click and drag to rotate.
Hold right click and drag to move.
Use mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
Click a cell to place your marker on it.

## How To Play
Qubic is similar to tic tac toe, but is played on a 4x4x4 cube. As in regular tic tac toe, players take turn placing their markers. The first player to place 4 markers in a line or diagonal wins. The lines and diagonals can be vertical, going through multiple boards.
